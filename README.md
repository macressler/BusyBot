BusyBot
=======

BusyBot is an Android library that aims to allow models to persist through RESTful services. Interaction with the models that inherit from the BusyBot model is based on the Active Record pattern. Simple caching is built in (although there is currently no way to overide it). This project is very much a work in progress.
